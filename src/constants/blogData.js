    authorName: "rambo",
    para: "You should feel a frisson of excitement when it comes to a serious conversation about compensation with a potential future boss. There is a lot on the line for them, too. Here is how you manage the compensation expectations discussion like a pro.",
    desc: `It is a key question for any candidate, but bide your time and approach the compensation expectations question with caution. It is certainly worth waiting until you know more about what the job entails. Has the hiring manager warmed up to the thought of hiring you?
  
        Every successful interview process turns into a negotiation at some point. It might seem strange when you find yourself in a back-and-forth salary negotiation for a job that you are keen on, but you only get one chance to get an increase in your starting salary. 
        
        Moving jobs is a proven way to make a step change in your compensation. If the candidate market is tight, you might be surprised just how much of an uplift you can demand. Here are a few things that we will cover in this blog:

    desc: `Perhaps the most difficult task in developing a resume is deciding exactly what you are best at. Certainly, the skills you list will depend on the job description, but when it comes down to it, your core competencies define you as a professional.
  
        Since hiring managers are likely to scan this easy-to-read section first, it’s paramount that you curate your core competencies with thought and intention. If they don’t find what they are looking for here, they are unlikely to read on.
